Here I use common R syntax to produce the word "Merry" as an output.
````{r}
library(reticulate)
Happy<-"Merry"
Happy
````
Next, I use Python syntax to produce the word "Christmas"
````{python}
Holidays="Christmas!"
print(Holidays)
````
Reticulate will allow both functions to be used together!
````{python}
print(r.Happy,Holidays)
````
When using R and python, the two can preform the same functions, but the syntax is different. Reticulate allows for R and Python to communicate together which is pretty cool!
````{r}
Another<-"Thank you for a"
````

````{python}
Example="great semester!!"
````

````{python}
print(r.Another,Example)
````
